        <h3>Hey there, ðŸ‘‹</h3>
        I'm <span> Aveen </span>, a software engineer <span>with more than 2 years of experience </span>.
        I build websites with a focus on responsiveness, accessibility and pleasing aesthetics.
        My experience in front-end development has equipped me with a solid understanding of
        modern web technologies and best practices.
        I have developed robust web applications using <span>Vue.js, Nuxt.js and React.js</span>, demonstrating my proficiency in
        component-based architecture, state management, server-side rendering, etc.. While I specialize in
        <span> frontend development,</span> I'm also delving into <span>backend technologies.</span>
        I'm all ears for <span>new opportunities</span> to create awesome software solutions.
        Let's team up and cook up some digital wonders together.
